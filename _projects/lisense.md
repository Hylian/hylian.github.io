LiSense generates powerful analytic insights about foot traffic in a venue. It uses a LIDAR with a machine learning model to detect individuals and crowds within a large space, and then displays customer engagement metrics using a real-time web interface. LiSense has many practical applications, from physical A/B testing of store promotions, quantitatively measuring exhibit popularity, to optimizing foot traffic through public spaces.
